                  At EDUFY, we offer two primary types of study rooms: Public
                  Rooms and Private Rooms. Public Rooms are open to all users
                  and ideal for collaborative learning, community discussions,
                  or open-topic study sessions. Anyone can request to join, and
                  these rooms foster knowledge sharing across a wider audience.
                  They’re perfect for students preparing for competitive exams,
                  subject-specific groups, or even peer mentoring.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Private Rooms, on the other hand, are invite-only or require
                  approval to join. These are designed for focused group work,
                  such as project teams, tutoring sessions, or study circles.
                  Hosts have full control over participation, content, and room
                  management. With features like file uploads, curriculum
                  organization, and participant moderation, EDUFY rooms provide
                  a dynamic, structured, and user-friendly environment for every
                  learner’s need.

                  At EDUFY, auctions provide a dynamic way for users to access
                  premium resources, tutoring sessions, or exclusive study
                  materials. When an auction is listed, users can place bids
                  within a set timeframe. The highest bidder at the end of the
                  auction wins the offering—whether it’s a one-on-one session
                  with a tutor, a curriculum package, or unique academic
                  content. All bids are visible in real-time, making the process
                  transparent and engaging.

                  To participate, users simply need to be registered and logged
                  into their EDUFY account. Notifications are sent for key
                  updates like being outbid or winning an auction. EDUFY ensures
                  secure bidding and fair competition. Whether you're looking to
                  enhance your learning or monetize your expertise, the auction
                  system opens new possibilities for both learners and educators
                  on the platform.

                  EDUFY is a collaborative online learning platform that allows
                  students to create, join, and manage virtual study rooms.
                  These rooms serve as focused spaces where learners can share
                  knowledge, discuss topics, upload study materials, and engage
                  in academic conversation. Whether you're studying for exams,
                  working on group projects, or exploring a subject in-depth,
                  EDUFY provides an interactive environment designed to boost
                  productivity and enhance understanding.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The platform empowers students to take charge of their
                  learning by offering tools such as file sharing, discussion
                  boards, and real-time messaging. Hosts can moderate
                  discussions, manage participants, and ensure the quality of
                  content being shared. By bringing together students with
                  similar academic goals, EDUFY turns solitary studying into a
                  supportive and efficient group experience.

                  Joining a room on EDUFY is simple and student-friendly. You
                  can browse or search for rooms based on topic, subject, or
                  creator. Once you find a room of interest, click the "Join"
                  button. If the room is open, you’ll be added immediately. If
                  it requires approval, a request will be sent to the host, who
                  will then accept or reject your entry.

                <br />
                <p>
                  After being approved, you’ll get a notification confirming

                  files, participate in discussions, and collaborate with other
                  participants. This controlled access system ensures rooms
                  remain focused and relevant while giving hosts full authority
                  over their space.

                  Yes, EDUFY encourages collaborative learning by enabling file
                  sharing within each study room. Whether it's lecture notes,
                  assignments, presentations, or PDFs, participants and hosts
                  can upload materials directly to the room. These files are
                  easily accessible to all room members, creating a shared
                  knowledge base that enhances learning.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  This feature is especially helpful for group study sessions or
                  when preparing for exams. Instead of juggling emails or
                  external drives, all your academic resources live in one
                  place, organized by room and topic. The file-sharing
                  capability keeps the learning environment centralized and
                  clutter-free.

                  Room hosts on EDUFY have powerful tools to manage the learning
                  environment. They can approve or reject join requests, remove
                  participants, moderate discussions, and oversee file uploads.
                  This control helps maintain a focused and respectful
                  atmosphere, where participants can collaborate effectively.

                  In addition, hosts receive notifications about new join
                  requests or any significant changes in the room. They can also
                  upload key study materials and guide discussions toward
                  productive outcomes. EDUFY ensures that hosts have the
                  necessary authority to curate their rooms while promoting
                  collaboration and peer learning.

                    "This app is a game-changer for students. I joined a study
                    group for Math and it made a huge difference. Everyone
                    shares notes, and the curriculum section helps track what
                    we’ve covered. Highly recommend to every student!"
